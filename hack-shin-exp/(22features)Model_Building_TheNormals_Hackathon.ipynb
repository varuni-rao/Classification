This machine learning exercise aims to determine the relative importance of each parameter about their contribution to the passengers' overall travel experience. The dataset contains a random sample of individuals who traveled on this train. The on-time performance of the trains along with passenger information is published in a file named 'Traveldata_train.csv'.  These passengers were later asked to provide their feedback on various parameters related to the travel along with their overall experience. These collected details are made available in the survey report labeled 'Surveydata_train.csv'.\n","\n","In the survey, each passenger was explicitly asked whether they were satisfied with their overall travel experience or not, and that is captured in the data of the survey report under the variable labeled 'Overall_Experience', which is the target variable.\n","\n","The objective of this problem is to understand which parameters play an important role in swaying passenger feedback towards a positive scale. We are provided with test data containing the travel data and the survey data of passengers. Both the test data and the train data are collected at the same time and belong to the same population."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"aMWSTmySvBv6"},"source":["## **Solution**\n","\n","The given problem statement suggests that the problem is a Supervised learning classification problem. We will use various Machine Learning models available in the library for classification and observe which model gives us the best accuracy on the test set and select it as our final model."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"A_I7voU1vJu-"},"source":["### **Loading
